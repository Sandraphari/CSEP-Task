_Approach_

My approach for scraping the data of December 2022 and January 2023 was to choose 'Select Range' in the Delivery Period and for each month,
I did the scraping process separately. First, I chose 01/12/2022 as Starting Date and 31/12/2022 as End Date. From this, I scraped 2 types
of data as two different dataframes. One includes the Area Prices and the Market Clearing Price for each Bid Areas at different time blocks.
The other one shows the average of traded hours price in different hours.
Similarly, I scraped all these data for 2023 January also.
Then, I combined both the data. 
 
 
_Outputs_

Outpus are two dataframes:
1) 'Time_block_data.csv' - That includes the Area Prices and the Market Clearing Price for each Bid Areas at different time blocks.
2) 'Average_prices.csv' -  That shows the average of traded hours price in different hours.


_Analysis_

Sorry, due to the lack of time I could invest in this task, I was not able to do the analysis part.


_Scope for Improvement_

If had more time, I would have done the EDA part. Also, I would have improved upon my scaping code so that it would be more readble and 
easily understandable. Moreover, I would have tried to make the scraping script more generalized, that is, making it more flexible to fetch 
the data for any month of any year as per requirement.
